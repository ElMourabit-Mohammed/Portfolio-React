# React Portfolio Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This portfolio was built using ReactJS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

In this portfolio, you will find information about my education, work experience, and skills. You will also be able to view some of the projects I have worked on in the past.

To get started, simply click on one of the links in the navigation bar at the top of the page. You can also use the search bar to search for specific information.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio!
